  </ol>

  <h2>How TechViper Works</h2>

  <p>TechViper combines static and dynamic analysis techniques to scan web applications for vulnerabilities. It carefully examines the application's codebase to identify potential security weaknesses and also performs runtime testing by injecting payloads and analyzing the responses. This hybrid approach enables TechViper to detect vulnerabilities that may be missed by traditional scanning methods, providing you with a more comprehensive security assessment.</p>

  <p>TechViper employs intelligent payload injection techniques specific to each vulnerability type. By crafting payloads that exploit the unique characteristics of vulnerabilities like XSS or SQL Injection, TechViper simulates real-world attacks and identifies potential entry points that malicious actors could exploit. This proactive scanning approach helps you stay one step ahead of attackers and strengthens the security posture of your web applications.</p>
